## About raising issues
Raising issues is essential for the continued development of the site.  
If you have an idea, please propose it via Issues at the top of the repository.

## About source code read/write permissions
Currently, no direct editing privileges are granted even to accounts within the organisation.  
This is a measure of equality to ensure that the organisation's repository is run entirely by the community.  
If you want to contribute to the organisation's repository, you must first fork the repository.  
Then open a pull request for the organisation's repository from the repository you forked.  

## About reviews
You can specify an account within the organisation.  
You will also automatically be reviewed by Gemini Code Assist.
